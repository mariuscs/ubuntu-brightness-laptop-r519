Python script for enabling brightness control for Samsung R519 laptop
http://code.google.com/p/ubuntu-brightness-laptop-r519/

--------------
INSTALATION
-------------

You need Python 2.3 for this script to work. 
1. Just copy this file to /usr/local/bin/brightness and make it executable. 
2. chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/brightness

This script requires root access, so you should enable visudo to not asking you for password every time you execute this script. 
To achieve this you should :

1. Type: visudo
2. Edit file so there's 2 lines like this.

# Members of the admin group may gain root privileges
%admin ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL

# Allow members of group sudo to execute any command
%sudo   ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL

3. Try to run from normal user account:

> brightness up
> brightness down


. It should not ask you for password. The brightness should slightly change. Repeat command to change more. 

That's it. You can now bind hardware keys for this script. In UNITY desktop GUI find System Settings -> Keyboard Shortcuts. Add 2 new entries:

1> brightness_up
pointing to /usr/local/bin/brightness up

2> brightness_down
pointing to /usr/local/bin/brightness down


That's it. Type FN->Brightness up and down to see how it works.
